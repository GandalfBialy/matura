# What does matura repository contain?
Solutions for matura exams tasks
These are solved with:
-Python (programing language I'm going to use during the exam)
-C++ (my first and main "algorithm" programming language)
-Excel
-Access + SQL

Besides of practical tasks I also upload my solutions for theory tasks and they might contain errors (usually marked with red pen)
