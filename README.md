   - **write an algorithm**, allowed notations are:
     - step list
     - pseudocode
     - real programming language
   - **general IT knowledge** like:
     - number systems &ndash; calculations
     - network, IPv4
     - SQL
     - Excel
     - systems (Windows, Linux)
     - hardware (CPU, GPU, etc.)
     - file extensions
     - images, colors
     - other
2. **part &ndash; practice and real use of IT tools**
   - **analyze big sets od related data** &ndash; usually 3 or 4 files

   - **write a programme**, allowed languages are:

     - **Java**
     - Pascal

## **Practical tasks are solved with:**

- **Python** &ndash; I'm going to use it during the proper exam
- **C++** &ndash; my first and main "algorithmic" programming language
- **Excel** &ndash; to analyze
- **Access + SQL** &ndash; to analyze big sets of data

### Besides of practical tasks I also upload my solutions for theory tasks

Alert! They might contain errors, but usually are marked in red.

## Btw, **what is matura exam**?

It's a state exam in Poland, quite important if you want to study at some nice university of technology, but not only. In my opinion it's great if we consider advantages of preparing to it. You don't have to learn useless stuff just for an exam, because actually it's useful in real life &ndash; programming & algorithms, Excel, SQL, general knowledge.
